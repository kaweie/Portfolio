# Portfolio
These are some of my deep learning projects. I completed a total of three different projects:

1. An algorithm that distinguishes the difference between cats and dogs. This algorithm worked around 80% and I completed this without
Imagenet. There files associated with this are titled "CatsDogs.ipynb", "CatsDogs1.ipynb", and "CatsDogs2.ipynb". This project was written
through tensorflow, but not tensorflow.keras.
  a. "CatsDogs.ipynb" is set up to just process the data.
  b. "CatsDogs1.ipynb" is set up to set up the model.
  c. "CatsDogs2.ipynb" is set up just to test my model on. It was just me testing some of my personal images on my algorithms.

2. A deep network that distinguishes between just tulips and sunflowers. This project is under the titles "Flowers-TulipsVsunflower.html"
and "Bi-Flowers-VGG16.model". 
  a. "Flowers-TulipsVsunflower.html" this document shows the results of a deep network that I trained. This algorithm tells the difference
  between a tulip and a sunflower. My algorithm was correct 90% of the time. This model was trained using the ImageNet algorithm.
  b. "Bi-Flowers-VGG16.model" is the actual model that I used.

3. A deep learning network that tells the distinguishes between roses, daisies, tulips, and sunflowers. This is just like the previous
project, but with two more classes. This algorithm was only correct between 75% and 80% of the time. This is titled "Flowers-Plural.html".
This algorithm didn't seem to work with more obscure pictures of the flowers. Some of the pictures in my validation set that were very
similar to other kinds of flowers. This file is the code and the results of the validation set.
